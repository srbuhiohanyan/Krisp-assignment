00:00.000 --> 00:08.800
I've lived in many different countries, both in Western Europe, Middle East and now here

00:08.800 --> 00:14.240
in Hong Kong, and during all of that time I've learned five or six different languages

00:14.240 --> 00:16.240
to one degree or another.

00:16.240 --> 00:21.200
I love learning languages, not only are they important when you move to a country, I just

00:21.200 --> 00:24.280
find them fascinating.

00:24.280 --> 00:29.800
Before I came to Hong Kong, I lived in Barcelona, Spain for ten years, and when I first arrived

00:29.800 --> 00:34.000
the most important thing was being able to communicate with people locally.

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
I don't attend classes, I don't think I'm particularly good in classes.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.120
I prefer to learn by just talking to people, finding out what I need to say by looking

00:44.120 --> 00:46.440
at dictionaries and listening carefully.
