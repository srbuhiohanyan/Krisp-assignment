0	8800	I've lived in many different countries, both in Western Europe, Middle East and now here
8800	14240	in Hong Kong, and during all of that time I've learned five or six different languages
14240	16240	to one degree or another.
16240	21200	I love learning languages, not only are they important when you move to a country, I just
21200	24280	find them fascinating.
24280	29800	Before I came to Hong Kong, I lived in Barcelona, Spain for ten years, and when I first arrived
29800	34000	the most important thing was being able to communicate with people locally.
34000	39000	I don't attend classes, I don't think I'm particularly good in classes.
39000	44120	I prefer to learn by just talking to people, finding out what I need to say by looking
44120	46440	at dictionaries and listening carefully.
