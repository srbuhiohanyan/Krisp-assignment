{"text": " I've lived in many different countries, both in Western Europe, Middle East and now here in Hong Kong, and during all of that time I've learned five or six different languages to one degree or another. I love learning languages, not only are they important when you move to a country, I just find them fascinating. Before I came to Hong Kong, I lived in Barcelona, Spain for ten years, and when I first arrived the most important thing was being able to communicate with people locally. I don't attend classes, I don't think I'm particularly good in classes.
