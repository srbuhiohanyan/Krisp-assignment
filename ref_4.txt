If you believe, you can move the highest mountains
Cross the greatest oceans and walk across the water, the water
You feel defeated, falling on your knees, and
Looking up for some hope tonight
You try to stand up, but you throw your hands up
Like you no longer have the strength to fight
Cause you’ve seen too many sunsets, too many days
Ending in the darkest night
But, on your own, you’ll never know
You’ll never know
If you believe, you can move the highest mountains
Cross the greatest ocеans, walk across the water, the watеr
Believe, you can move the highest mountains
Cross the greatest oceans, walk across the water
If you believe
They say that all you need is faith
But it’s almost like you lost your way
Took a few wrong turns, took a few breaks
Falling behind now, looking for grace
Cause you need someone to lift you up
Yeah, make right all the things you done
Cause on your own, you’ll never know
You’ll never know
If you believe, you can move the highest mountains
Cross the greatest oceans, walk across the water, the water
Believe, you can move the highest mountains
Cross the greatest oceans, walk across the water
If you believe
If you believe, yeah
You can do anything, you can do anything
You can do anything if you believe
If you believe, you can move the highest mountains
Cross the greatest oceans, walk across the water, the water
Believe, you can move the highest mountains
Cross the greatest oceans, walk across the water
If you believe
