I want to talk about living stress today.
Life here in Hong Kong is very stressful so I think today's topic is very useful for everyone
because we can do something about it just to cope with the stress.
So maybe you have some change in your life, maybe big change or small change
but instead of being afraid, I think you should have a positive attitude
and think of change as a normal part of life.
