00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Once upon a time there lived a wise man by the name of Mamet.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
He never liked.

00:09.000 --> 00:16.000
All the people in the land, even the ones who lived 20 days away, knew about him.

00:16.000 --> 00:22.000
The king feared about Mamet and ordered his subject to go into the palace.
