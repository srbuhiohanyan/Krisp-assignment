1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,800
I've lived in many different countries, both in Western Europe, Middle East and now here

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,240
in Hong Kong, and during all of that time I've learned five or six different languages

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,240
to one degree or another.

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,200
I love learning languages, not only are they important when you move to a country, I just

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,280
find them fascinating.

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:29,800
Before I came to Hong Kong, I lived in Barcelona, Spain for ten years, and when I first arrived

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,000
the most important thing was being able to communicate with people locally.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I don't attend classes, I don't think I'm particularly good in classes.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,120
I prefer to learn by just talking to people, finding out what I need to say by looking

10
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,440
at dictionaries and listening carefully.
